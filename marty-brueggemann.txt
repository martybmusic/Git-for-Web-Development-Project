Stretch Questions

Use the value 'relative' for the property 'position'.

Block: <header>, <div>, <p>
Inline: <a>, <span>, <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

The 'box model' in CSS is a way to visualize every html element. Inside the box is 'content', surrounded by 'padding', then 'border', then 'margin'. We need to be mindful of these outer elements when setting width. In total, width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin.
